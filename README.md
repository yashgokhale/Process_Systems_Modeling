Folders hw1-4 contain the solutions.

## Global optimization of Gas Lifting Operations using Piecewise Linear Functions
The models used were referenced from: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ie8012117
Four models were optimized in GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling Software) as follows:
1. Classic Method
2. Linear Segmentation Method
3. Convex Hull Method
4. Special Structure Method

Apart from replicating the results in the original paper, effort was taken to tabulate the CPU Times and observe the trends of each of the models as follows:

You can get back to me at ysg@andrew.cmu.edu for any further clarifications or suggestions.
